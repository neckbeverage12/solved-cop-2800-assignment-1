For this assignment you will write a simple Java program.  Write a class called <strong>Print</strong>.  This class has only a <strong>main</strong> method.  The <strong>main</strong> method has a single <strong>for</strong> loop with an index that increments from 0 to 19.   At each iteration of the loop, if the current value of the index is multiple of 3, the loop should print:

“How now

brown cow”  using a <strong>single</strong> print statement.

If the loop index is not divisible by 3, the loop should print:

“How now brown cow” using <strong>two</strong> print statements, one for the first two words and one for the last two words.

Your output should start out like this:

<strong>How now</strong>

<strong>brown cow</strong>

<strong>How now brown cow</strong>

<strong>How now brown cow </strong>

<strong>How now</strong>

<strong>brown cow</strong>

<h1>How now brown cow</h1>

<strong>How now brown cow </strong>

<strong>How now</strong>

<strong>brown cow</strong>

<strong>How now brown cow</strong>

<strong>How now brown cow</strong>

Examination of different methods to do printing would be helpful as well as a review of escape sequences and a review of the remainder operator should be helpful in this assignment.

If your program compiles, but you get a runtime error stating that <strong>main</strong> can’t be found, check the signature of your <strong>main</strong> method to be sure it’s correct.
